	 * Scenario: You are a database administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollment and balance.
	 * The application should do the following
	 * - Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
	 * - The user should be promoted to enter the name and year for each student
	 * - The student should have 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
	 * - A student can enroll in the following courses
	 * 		History 101
	 * 		Mathematics 101
	 * 		English 101
	 * 		Chemistry 101
	 * 		Computer Science 101
	 * - Each course costs $600 to enroll 
	 * - The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
	 * - To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
